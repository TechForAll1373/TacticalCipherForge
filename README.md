A military-grade, client-side password generator built with modern web technologies. Forge unbreakable, high-entropy ciphers with tactical precision directly in your browser. No server, no tracking, just pure cryptographic strength.

## ✨ Key Features

-   🔐 **Military-Grade Entropy:** Utilizes the browser's native `Crypto` API for cryptographically secure random number generation.
-   🛡️ **Client-Side Security:** All operations happen on your device. Your ciphers are never transmitted or stored on any server.
-   🎨 **Advanced Tactical UI:** A clean, modern, and responsive interface inspired by military command systems.
-   📜 **Local History Log:** Securely stores your recently generated ciphers in browser cache for quick access.
-   ⚙️ **Customizable Protocols:** Fine-tune your ciphers with a wide range of character sets, including options to exclude ambiguous characters.
-   📱 **Fully Responsive:** Works flawlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
-   ♿ **Accessible:** Built with ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation in mind.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TechForAll1373/TacticalCipherForge.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash

    ```
3.  **Open `index.html` in your favorite web browser.**
    That's it! No build process or dependencies required.

## ⚙️ Character Set Protocols

You can customize your cipher using the following protocols:

| Protocol | Description | Example Characters |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ALPHA (A-Z)** | Uppercase Latin alphabets | `A, B, C, ..., Z` |
| **ALPHA (a-z)** | Lowercase Latin alphabets | `a, b, c, ..., z` |
| **NUMERIC (0-9)** | Digits from zero to nine | `0, 1, 2, ..., 9` |
| **SPECIAL** | Common punctuation and symbols | `!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?` |
| **Exclude Ambiguous** | Removes characters like `l`, `1`, `O`, `0` | N/A |

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

Your security is our top priority.

-   **No Server Interaction:** The entire application runs in your browser. We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your data.
-   **Cryptographically Secure:** We leverage `window.crypto.getRandomValues()`, a standard API for generating random numbers suitable for cryptographic use.
-   **Open Source:** The code is publicly available for security experts and developers to audit.

## 🧱 Technology Stack

-   **HTML5:** Semantic markup for structure.
-   **CSS3:** Modern styling with animations, Grid, and Flexbox.
-   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** Clean, modular, and efficient logic without any frameworks.
-   **Google Fonts (Fira Code):** For the authentic terminal aesthetic.
-   **Font Awesome:** For crisp, scalable icons.
